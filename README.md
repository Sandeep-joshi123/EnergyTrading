### 🧪 Our Experience

This was our **first-ever hackathon**, and it was an intense, exciting, and highly rewarding experience. The 24-hour format pushed us beyond our comfort zones, and we gained real exposure to what rapid innovation, teamwork, and tech problem-solving look like under pressure.

One of the most enriching aspects of the event was the **opportunity to collaborate with seniors and mentors**—people we had never met before. Despite that, we were able to **build strong communication, learn from their experience**, and significantly **expand our technical and professional network**.
