# Peer to Peer Energy Trading in cities like Bengaluru
 
Energy-trading
📌 Overview
The Energy Trade Platform is a decentralized web-based application that enables users to buy, sell, and trade solar energy units seamlessly.
It combines IoT hardware (ESP32, sensors, controllers) with a modern web dashboard to create a transparent and efficient peer-to-peer energy exchange system.

🌍 Problem Statement
Traditional energy distribution systems are centralized, costly, and inefficient, often leading to wastage or limited accessibility.
With the rise of renewable sources like solar power, there is a growing need for platforms that allow individuals and communities to share surplus energy and reduce dependency on centralized grids.

This project is an Energy Trade Platform that enables users to share and exchange surplus solar energy through a smart meter and web application. The idea is simple: If a user produces extra energy that would otherwise go to waste, they can sell it using the platform. If another user needs energy, they can buy it directly from the seller through the app. The system uses a current sensor in a smart meter to measure the amount of energy produced and consumed. The data is sent to the web application, where users can: List energy for sale when they have surplus Browse available energy and purchase when they need more Complete payments securely using UPI apps (like PhonePe, Google Pay, or Paytm) This creates a community-based energy trading system where no energy goes to waste, users save costs, and producers can earn money from their extra solar power.
